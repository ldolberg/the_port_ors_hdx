(Source: http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/local/brothers-brother-foundation-pittsburgh-nepal-aid/nk6WG/)

BBF has 40 staff members plus volunteers on the ground. Has partnered with Himalayan HealthCare a Nepal-based charity, ADRA International and others to provide emergency relief. Himalayan HealthCare has provided primary healthcare, education and income-generation opportunities in rural Nepal for 23 years.  In addition to training health workers, Himalayan HealthCare provides vaccine administration, supplies essential medicines to remote villages and helps patients secure specialty care. BBF will also be working with ADRA International (Adventist Development and Relief Agency) which is focused on a response to the earthquake helping with health and shelter needs. (Source - Luke Hingson, BBF Staff, by email)

BBF is currently working with Remote Area Medical (RAM), Himalayan Health Care, International Medical Relief (IMR), and Cardio Start all of whom have medical professionals on the ground in Nepal.  Himalayan Healthcare is an organization whose focus is the health of the people of the region and their clinics are an integral part of life in the region.  Cardio Start has adapted a planned trip to the region for solely cardiac care to meet a more general need.  Remote Area Medical and International Medical Relief are responding specifically to the crisis.  IMR (based in Loveland, Co.) has a minimum of 5 teams traveling to Nepal over the coming weeks for medical purposes. 
Specifically regarding Himalayan Healthcare, Brother’s Brother is supporting a team of international doctors leaving this weekend to supplement the work of the 40 permanent in country Nepalese staff.  Himalayan Healthcare’s hospital in Ilam (Megh Bahadur Parajuli Community Hospital) was only slightly affected by the quake and is currently operational.  Several clinics operated by Himalayan Healthcare in the villages of Tipling, Sherthung, Borang, Lapa and Jharlang were completely destroyed.  The international team of physicians will be a small team and will be in country for up to three weeks.
BBF itself will continue to support the work of organizations sending teams in the coming weeks and months.  Also as Himalayan Health Care articulates the needs of their clinics in the region BBF will continue our partnership with them to meet their needs as they arise.

Assistance includes search and rescue teams, technical equipment such as water purification systems and ICT support as well as other technical assistance. An EU Civil Protection team, including experts in structural engineering, is operating on the ground. The Commission is co-financing transport costs of EU aid to Nepal.
 
The European Commission's Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) monitors developments and coordinates support 24/7. The Copernicus Emergency Management Service has been activated for the provision of satellite images/maps of the disaster area to support the ongoing operations.

The EU assistance will address the most urgent needs and focus in particular on the most vulnerable groups. The aid will be channelled via European Commission's Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection Department (ECHO)'s humanitarian partner organisations operating on the ground. It is expected that early recovery activities and longer term rehabilitation will also be needed. Logistics are a major challenge for relief operations in the mountainous region. Airport capacity is limited.

Apr 29 - EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Christos Stylianides, together with the UN Under-Secretary-General, Valerie Amos, responsible for the international coordination of the humanitarian response travelled to Nepal and visited the affected areas. Within the first 24 hours after the earthquake - Initial response - the European Commission activated the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (EU CPM) upon request from the Nepali authorities, dispatched humanitarian experts to Nepal - first response teams and assets from the Member States - and released € 3 million to help address the most urgent needs: clean water, food, medicine, emergency shelter and telecommunication.

LWR began working in Nepal in 2009 to improve food security in for indigenous, Dalit and marginalized communities. Despite recent declines in poverty, Nepal remains one of the poorest countries in the world. Rural communities often struggle with household food security and are extremely vulnerable to frequent natural hazards, including flash floods, landslides and earthquakes. Poverty affords communities few resources to prepare for or mitigate the effects of these hazards and even fewer resources to recover, which can destroy development gains. LWR promotes resilience and long-term development in the communities in which it works by better preparing communities for natural hazards and helping families realize food security and savings. In Nepal, LWR currently works with local partners on agriculture, food security, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction (DRR) projects.

Deerwalk is located in Kathmandu, and they’ve kindly offered use of their facilities as a base. Meanwhile, our coordination with the World Health Organization indicates that areas more remote than Kathmandu require aid, so we will transport volunteers daily from Deerwalk facilities to red zones in order to maximize our resources.

The WHO is still assessing the situation and will get back to us soon on which remote areas are in the most dire need. The WHO is working in tandem with the Nepal Ministry of Health, so in this situation WHO = Nepal Government. We will do our very best to go where they ask us to.

Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit,,,NGO - International,Switzerland,Protection,Health,,,,"On the evening of 28 April 2015, a 10-strong medical team will fly to Nepal as part of the “Mother and Child” unit to provide medical support in the disaster area for women in childbirth and to perform surgery on children there. The deployment of the team of doctors by the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit is the first response measure to be taken following an initial assessment of the situation by the rapid response team sent to the region on 26 April 2015 in the wake of the devastating earthquake in the Himalayas.

The “Mother and Child” unit is a rapid response medical team deployed by the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit. On Tuesday evening, eight medical personnel and two logistics experts will depart from Belp airport for Nepal. The team will travel on the Federal Council’s official jet in cooperation with the Swiss Air Force operated by the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS).

The “Mother and Child” rapid response team was set up based on experience acquired following the earthquake in Haiti. Medical personnel can be sent to reinforce existing health teams only a few days after a disaster hits. Central to their work are surgical operations on children and childbirth support. The team will take with it the medical equipment needed for its work. The flight on 28 April 2015 will carry 562 kg of equipment. Together with personal equipment, the plane will thus have a total cargo of 1 tonne.

The Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit decided to deploy this 10-strong team following an evaluation by the advance detachment sent on Sunday, 26 April. The six-member group of experts assessed the situation and the requirements in the disaster area upon their arrival in the Nepalese capital, took charge of coordination with the authorities and the local partners on the ground, supplied first aid and supported the Swiss embassy and the cooperation office of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation in Kathmandu. The plan is for this team to be joined by eight specialists from the Swiss Disaster Relief Unit. A larger consignment of aid is scheduled to be delivered on Thursday, 30 April 2015.",,,,,,

The Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC) is a global network of organizations that work together to provide common communications services in humanitarian emergencies. Within 48 hours of a disaster, the ETC provides vital security communications services and voice and internet connectivity. Within four weeks, ETC services are expanded for continued emergency relief.
Staff from all humanitarian organizations can use ETC services, regardless of membership. The World Food Programme (WFP) is the Global ETC lead - has responsibility for coordinating the deployment and implementation of security and data communications services as well as effective inter-agency telecommunications services in emergencies.
ETC Partners are UN agencies and programmes, Governments and government-funded organisations, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). Standby Partners (SBP) work together with ETC through WFP. SBP are organizations, including Government Agencies, NGOs and foundations, who have signed an agreement with WFP to maintain a roster of rapidly deployable staff (within 72H) and equipment to support WFP emergency operations - Profiles available for deployment depend on the individual organisation, but typically include Telecommunications and IT specialists, electricians and project managers.
Access to Situation reports, Project reports, Meeting minutes, Maps and photos is gained by becoming a registered user. To register, email the following information to ictemergency@wfp.org. Registration is restricted to members of the humanitarian community - not all applications are approved. You will be informed of the status of your application within 24 hours.","Common telecommunications services in humanitarian emergencies

Constraints:
 Organizations should ensure more visibility of their distribution and movement to support the Logistics Cluster to better plan transport and storage capacity.
 Air assets will be deployed only to reach remote locations which are currently not viable by road. This means that alternative transportation arrangements are required for any other movement. The limited aircraft slot into Kathmandu Airport continues to remain a constraint.

The logistics cluster is involved in the coordination of fork lifts and other handling equipment this week to move goods beyond the airport; is preparing for the second phase of its aid operation by scouting roads, assessing other infrastructure and setting up a more sophisticated distribution network over a longer distance across the mountains to provide a steady flow of goods. Is trying to identify a second “strategic entry point” to the region, so relief groups can use smaller cargo aircraft and fly in more frequently. Will monitor rate of local recovery; future tasks to be determined by types of economic structures in place.  

Additional Logistics Cluster hubs including Pokhara and Birganj are planned to be established. An inter-agency fleet has been contracted and road transport will be made available to the humanitarian community. (UNRC, Log cluster)

It contains non-injectable drugs, medical supplies and some essential equipment, accompanied by simple treatment guidelines. Basic equipment also has a complete sterilization set and items to help provide for clean water at the health facility. The supplementary unit contains drugs, renewable supplies and equipment needed by doctors working in first- or second-referral health facilities.
