The overall monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) framework for the project are based on the principles of Developmental Evaluation (DE), which sees evaluation not as a static end-point but as a strategic learning approach to decision-making. Action occurs throughout the life of the project, as actors and issues emerge, shift, and take unexpected turns that affect strategies and thus the results of the project. Evidence Based Advocacy: Tipping Point’s advocacy strategy seeks to use learning and documentation from field experience to build evidence to support the actions of local, national, and global coalitions, activists, and decision-makers against child marriage.

Poverty levels are negatively impacted by both low secondary school enrollment rates and the lack of appropriate infrastructure in a country with difficult terrain. Just 32% of young women (between the ages of 20 and 24) have received at least a secondary education. Edge of Seven's Community Development Program was founded to specifically address these issues.<br><br> The Community Development Program offers girls, their families and their villages increased access to educational opportunities with a goal of reducing poverty in rural Nepal. Program components include improving schools, building additional schools, creating access to clean water sources, and educating girls and families through workshops. This year, Edge of Seven plans to build both a women's community center and a higher secondary school extension with curriculum in community development.<br><br> When women and girls are educated, they tend to marry later, suffer less abuse, live healthier lives, and reinvest 90% of what they earn back into their communities. This year Edge of Seven's Community Development Program will offer educational opportunities to hundreds of individuals, creating a ripple effect in the entire region of rural Nepal. While this particular program will be driven from a local level, it will have a global impact, helping Nepal to reach the Millennium Development Goals.","","",2012-09-05,2015-11-13,"",Education,"",6440,Edge of Seven,"","","","",Nepal>Eastern,"","",sarah@edgeofseven.org,720-384-4537,http://globalgiving.org/10765,2014-11-25,2015-01-08,active,Private donations

We can prevent - and prevention is key - this modern slavery by educating girls. We go to the villages, find the girls most at risk, and give them all they need to stay in school - and safe. Education gives them confidence, value to their families and a future. The cost of this switch from dread to hope: $100 a year. That's how we Stop Girl Trafficking. Will you?<br><br> Human trafficking is a crisis in Nepal. Every year, up to 20,000 young girls from the poorest parts of the country are sold or lured by traffickers with promises of marriage or good jobs. Casualties of poverty, illiteracy and a caste system that does not value girls, they are forced into Indian brothels or domestic servitude. In either case, they are slaves. Many are HIV positive within two years, and dead before they reach twenty.<br><br> The way we combat this modern-day slavery is revolutionary and effective. We go into the villages where girls are at risk, and put those girls into school. For a small investment - $100 pays for everything: school fees, books, uniform, tutoring, mentoring - we can keep a girl safe and in school for an entire year. Educating those girls in danger of being trafficked and talking to the community about the risks, spreads awareness through the whole village. And traffickers stop going there.<br><br> We started with 54 at-risk girls 15 years ago. This year we have 10,000 girls in 400 schools across Nepal, and we haven't lost one girl to trafficking. Where we once had to persuade each family, whole villages are now asking to be included. And with each year a girl stays in school, she learns more and gains confidence.

Further complicating matters, monsoon season began in June, bringing more landslides, and exposing hundreds of thousands of displaced people to the elements.

All Hands waited until June to open Project Nepal to outside volunteers, so as not to add stress to the chaotic situation. We now have bases in Kathmandu and Sindhupalchok, and a clear sense of where and how we can help. Our volunteer ranks are comprised of both local and international volunteers.

It is estimated that over 1 million children previously enrolled in school are no longer attending classes because almost 90% of classrooms were destroyed or damaged.<br>

Stabilizing the education system is crucial for the country's long-term recovery and future success. Schools act as a catalyst for social, gender, and economic equality.

Hallmarks of the project:<br>

- Use of earthquake resistant designs and methods
- Skills training for local builders and residents, resulting in a certificate attesting to skill level attained (including skills in earthquake resistant building practices) for use in future job applications.
- Community participation 
- Volunteer capacity provided by All Hands large network of multi-skilled international volunteers and local volunteers, to provide the labor to meet tight timelines on multiple active work sites.","The All Hands - Room to Read partnership leverages the strengths of both partners to meet the overwhelming need in Nuwakot. For nearly two decades, Room to Read, a global education and gender-equality nonprofit, has tackled the chronic shortages of classrooms, equipment and teachers across the school systems of the poorest countries, with a special emphasis on Nepal. Room to Read has made steady progress in increasing educational opportunities throughout the poorest districts, like Nuwakot (see insert above) where families live on less than $2 per day. Room to Read has deep local knowledge and a proven methodology but the scale and scope of this disaster is testing their ability to respond, especially as they have not previously worked in a post-disaster context.

All Hands, with a decade of post-disaster recovery experience, is structured to flexibly and quickly adjust to these fluid and ever-changing environments. Utilizing skilled and experienced project managers, bolstered by multi-skilled volunteers drawn from all over the world, we know how to creatively deal with: disrupted supply chains; shortages of skilled and qualified local labor; cost uncertainties given material shortages; changing government regulations due to the disaster; challenges securing equipment and tools; and the countless other obstacles that arise each and every day. This “surge capacity” allows All Hands’ ability to deliver construction projects on the timelines needed, the quality required, and costs that are far lower than would be available in the “open market”.

According to a recent United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Nepal Earthquake Situation Report, 8,700 people are confirmed dead; another 100,000 have been injured. The report states that nearly 800,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed, displacing an estimated 2.8 million people. The situation is particularly urgent as disaster survivors face the monsoon season creating deadly floods and landslides causing further damage and reducing access to external aid resources. Without adequate housing, families are left to camp outside or live in tent camps where they are vulnerable to the monsoon season and diseases caused by poor hygiene, as well as and remain isolated from support networks of neighbors and family. <br>

The Sindhupalchok District, located in central region of Nepal, is one of the hardest-hit districts by the earthquake and aftershocks. In May 2015, the United Nations Nepal Earthquake Assessment reported that out of 64 of the 79 village development committees (VDCs) in Sindhupalchock – an area with a population of 240,000 – 88% of the housing was damaged or destroyed, displacing 88% of the assessed population. In Sindhupalchok, women head 12% of households. Female-led households are particularly vulnerable as women are solely responsible for childcare and income generation.

","Together with its partners, Society of Nepalese Architects (""SONA""), the Department of Small Works, Architects Foundation, ARCASIA, and American Institute of Architects Foundation, All Hands proposes to construct permanent, earthquake- resilient  housing for displaced families in Sindhupalchok district of Nepal. The process will incorporate significant community and beneficiary input and participation. All Hands will act as lead implementing partner, and brings extensive expertise in project management, construction skills training, and volunteer mobilization in post-disaster reconstruction projects in developing countries. This contribution includes an international network of over 30,000 multi-skilled volunteers. <br>

This is a phased program that will be completed over two years, beginning with an assessment and design phase incorporating input from the local community, followed by a pilot phase in which homes will be built and a skilled work force developed by training beneficiaries. Input from the community will be gathered by a team of SONA and Department of Small Works designers  through workshops and meetings to address community needs and understand cultural context. SONA and All Hands will work to develop build criteria for beneficiary selection to identify the most vulnerable and urgent-care families . The criteria will account for vulnerabilities associated with female-led households and identify opportunities to train women builders and leaders. Once beneficiaries are selected, a team of project managers and construction experts will lead participants through training in building materials, building methods, and disaster risk reduction skills.

Doctors of the World-USA,MdM-NP-15-13853,"",nepal_earthquake,Nepal: Rapid Disaster Response,"In late spring 2015, Nepal was hit by two devastating earthquakes: a 7.8 magnitude quake on April 25, and the subsequent 7.3 quake on May 12. While Nepal continues to assess the damage, it is clear that more than 8,600 people have died, over 17,000 have been injured, and at least 500,000 have lost their homes. An estimated 60% of the country’s infrastructure (including roads, water supplies, and health centers, among other services) has been damaged, meaning that some 8 million people have been impacted by the earthquakes and ongoing aftershocks.<br>

Médecin du Monde (MdM) teams have set up clinics near the village of Golche in the Sindhupalchok district – a remote region that was one of the hardest hit in the quakes; and in the village of Sunkhani, where the health center was completely destroyed. MdM medical teams have evaluated 2,000 people and are providing basic healthcare to thousands in the area.<br>

In addition, our assessment teams are working with 6 remote villages in Sindhupalchok (Tangpatango, Bolde, Gumbatang, Lidi, Sunchagan, and Pongapur) to determine the communities’ needs. People living in these villages have been cut off from most aid and emergency response efforts as a result of impassable roads, landslides and collapsed bridges.<br>

The approaching monsoon season, set to begin in June and last throughout the summer months, is also a cause for concern. In Sindhupalchok, landslides are common during monsoon season, and this year the likelihood is even greater given the recent damage from the earthquakes.<br>

The monsoon season brings with it an increased risk of infection and contagious disease due to compromised sanitary conditions and lack of clean water supplies. To help reduce this risk, MdM is working in partnership with aid organization Solidarités International to equip families with in-home chlorination kits, hygiene kits, and latrine kits, and to provide training on the proper assembly and use of the kits.<br>

MdM has deployed in areas where the needs are greatest, and where we have long-standing relationships with the communities affected by the earthquakes, such as Sindhupalchok. We are committed to assisting in rebuilding Nepal’s fractured health system, and to re-establishing Nepalis access to clean water and sanitation. We will continue to provide medical personnel, supplies and equipment to deliver ongoing emergency and long-term healthcare to Nepalis in need.","","Long-Term Activities in Nepal: Improving Access to Sexual and Reproductive Health Services<br>

MdM has been working in the remote Sindhupalchok region – one of the hardest hit by the earthquakes – since 2007. Our objective is to increase access to sexual and reproductive health public services and to reduce factors contributing to maternal and neonatal mortality. Doctors of the World’s project intends both to ensure that quality health services are available at the community level (renovation and equipping of health facilities, training of health personnel, referrals) and to support women by improving their ability to access healthcare. The originality and sustainability of the project lies with the involvement of women in microfinance activities, and in education sessions on prevention and management of pregnancy, childbirth and post-natal care.<br>

MdM has partnered with two national organizations on the microfinance component: CEDCF looks after operations in the Sindhupalchok district and CMF provides technical support. MdM has also forged close links with Planet Finance, which shares its expertise in microfinance through training, evaluation and advice.",2015-04-25,2020-01-01,"Health,Shelter and Non-Food Items,Water Sanitation and Hygiene","Disaster Management,Health,Humanitarian aid,Non-food relief items (NFIs),Water Sanitation and Hygiene","","","","","","","",Nepal>Central,Tamera Gugelmeyer,Communications Director,tamera@doctorsoftheworld.org,646-307-7584,http://doctorsoftheworld.org/where-we-work/asia/nepal/,2015-06-18,2015-07-06,active,""
